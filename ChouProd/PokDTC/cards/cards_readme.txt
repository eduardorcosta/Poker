These card pictures were created by "someone" exclusively for the PokDTC 
project on sourceforge.net (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chouprod).
If you want to use them in your own project you have to ask the developer of
PokDTC, known as "Acetyle" or "Chouprod" on sourceforge.net for permission. 
Because the project is developed under GPL terms it should be no problem to 
use the graphics, but please give a credit to the developer 
Alexandre Chouvellon! THX.
To contact him "  chouprod       @       gmail   .      com " is the right 
address.
